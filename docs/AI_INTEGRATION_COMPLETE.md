## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key (3 mins)

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up / log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (format: `sk-proj-...`)

### Step 2: Add to .env (30 seconds)

Edit `/Users/sivaperiyasamy/Repos/hackathon/.env` and add:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 3: Restart Server (10 seconds)

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in npm start terminal)
npm start

# You should see:
# [INFO] OpenAI client initialized
```

### Step 4: Test It! (1 minute)

**Option A: Test Without WhatsApp (fastest)**

```bash
./test-api.sh test-ai +19193087138 "Hi! I want to create a dating profile"
```

You'll get a JSON response with the AI's reply!

**Option B: Test Via WhatsApp (requires ngrok webhook)**

Just send a WhatsApp message to +1 415 523 8886 and the AI will respond!

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Test AI directly (no WhatsApp needed)
./test-api.sh test-ai +19193087138 "Hello!"
./test-api.sh test-ai +19193087138 "Yes, I want to create a profile"

# Check conversation state
./test-api.sh ai-state +19193087138

# Reset and start over
./test-api.sh ai-reset +19193087138

# Send via WhatsApp
./test-api.sh whatsapp +19193087138 "Testing the AI matchmaker"
```

## 📋 API Endpoints

### New Endpoints:

## 🎭 Example Conversation

**User:** "Hi!"

**AI:** "Hey! 👋

I'm your AI matchmaker! I help people create dating profiles with their friends - because your friends know you best!

Want to create your profile together? (Just say yes or tell me what you're looking for!)"

**User:** "Yes! I want to create a profile"

**AI:** "Awesome! Let's make this fun and authentic.

First question: What's your name?"

**User:** "I'm Alex"

**AI:** "Nice to meet you, Alex!

So what brings you here? Are you looking for something serious, casual, or just seeing what's out there?"

## 🔧 Configuration

### AI Settings (in `ai-matchmaker.js`)

```javascript
model: 'gpt-4o-mini'       // Fast & affordable
temperature: 0.8           // Slightly creative
max_tokens: 150            // Short responses
```

### System Prompt
The AI is instructed to:
- Keep messages SHORT (1-3 sentences)
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Be conversational
- Use emojis naturally
- Remember context

### Conversation Stages
Currently tracked:
- `welcome` - Initial greeting
- Can be extended with: `questions`, `friend_feedback`, `profile_generation`, `approval`

## 💡 Next Steps for Development

### Phase 1: Test Basic Conversation (NOW!)
1. Get OpenAI API key
2. Add to .env
3. Test with `./test-api.sh test-ai`
4. Try a full conversation

### Phase 2: Set Up WhatsApp Webhook (Optional)
1. Get ngrok authtoken
2. Start ngrok: `ngrok http 3000`
3. Configure webhook in Twilio Console
4. Test by sending WhatsApp message

### Phase 3: Enhance AI Flow (1-2 hours)
1. Add conversation stages
2. Collect specific profile data
3. Add friend participation logic
4. Build profile generation

### Phase 4: Polish & Demo (1-2 hours)
1. Test full flow with team
2. Refine AI personality
3. Record demo
4. Create pitch

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**GPT-4o-mini pricing:**
- Super affordable: ~$0.50 for entire hackathon
- 100-200 messages = ~$0.05
- Testing for 2 days = ~$0.50 total

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"OpenAI client not initialized"**
→ Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env and restart server

**"Incorrect API key"**
→ Check format (should start with `sk-proj` or `sk-`)
→ Make sure no extra spaces

**AI responses are slow**
→ Normal! Takes 2-5 seconds
→ Worth the wait for quality responses

**Rate limit errors**
→ Free tier has limits
→ Wait a minute or add $5-10 credit
