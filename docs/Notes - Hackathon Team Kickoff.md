  * Vouching mechanism  \- like a badge “profile created with friends”   
* GTM  
  * 2 different modes for onboarding   
  * Invite code to launch with, or QR code  
  * Don’t market as Tinder  
* Match experience

## **One-pager for the Hackathon:**

**Feature Name (Working Title): *“Group-Chat \+ Matchmaker”* for family of MG brands**

**Vision:**  
Make online dating feel more social and less intimidating by turning profile creation into a group chat with friends.

### **Who We’re Building For**

**Abby (The Anxious Romantic)**

* 19, cautious, idealistic, feels pressure to “do dating right.”

* App-hesitant and needs emotional safety before joining.

* Trusts her friends more than algorithms; friends are her confidence boosters.

* Looking for a connection that feels sincere, not performative.

**Jasmine (The Joyful Butterfly)**

* 22, outgoing, socially fearless, and constantly seeking fun new connections.

* Uses Tinder on and off, mostly for discovery and IRL connections.

* Loves anything that feels social, spontaneous, and slightly gamified.

* Doesn’t want to slow down — wants to meet more people *her way*.

**Why They Matter:**  
Abby and Jasmine represent **two ends of the new-user funnel** — the hesitant joiner and the social instigator. Designing for both brings new women into the ecosystem *and* keeps outgoing users like Jasmine excited and active. Jasmine brings her friends in; Abby stays because it finally feels safe and supported.

### **How It Serves Abby \+ Jasmine**

| Feature | For Abby | For Jasmine |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Real SMS group chat | Feels like a safe space with trusted voices | Feels familiar and social — group texts \= her comfort zone |
| Friend co-creation | Removes pressure; feels supported | Fun, collaborative, shareable |
| Daily drops & voting | Keeps pace low and digestible | Adds gamified daily energy |
| Cross-portfolio matching | Expands opportunity without more apps | Delivers novelty and surprise |
| “Created with Friends” badge | Builds trust and authenticity | Becomes a social flex (“I made my friend’s profile”) |

**Problem to Solve:**  
Lots of would-be users (especially women) feel hesitant to download dating apps. They’re worried about starting solo, being judged, or dealing with the setup. Meanwhile, their friends are already nudging them: *“Come on, you’ll be great on this\!”* We’re missing the social spark, the friend moment, the “Hey I’m doing this with you” vibe.

**Solution Overview:**  
Imagine this: You grab your phone, text a number or scan a QR, and open a real SMS group chat with two of your friends \+ an AI matchmaker (witty, playful friend persona). You banter, you react, you drop emojis. The AI listens, picks up your style, mood and voice. It generates your profile, gets feedback (“Nah make me more outdoorsy”, “Let’s show that I’m funnier”), and then starts **daily SMS drops** of curated match recommendations into the group chat. Each day, you and your friends see **two profiles** (e.g., “Would you like to get to know Alex or Ben?”). You can all vote. The AI uses your collective feedback to refine what comes next. You only show up to people *you’ve approved*. And you earn a badge: **“Profile Created With Friends”** — a trust signal your friends helped, you chose, you own it.

**Key Experience Highlights:**

* Two entry paths: SMS direct (text number → immediate group chat) OR app install \+ phone number → optional divert to SMS group chat.

* Real friends in a real SMS thread; no fake bots pretending to be your friends.

* AI acts as a witty group member: listening, teasing, shaping tone, and offering profile tweaks..

* Feedback loop: friends can use reactions or micro-polls via app clip or SMS link; you (the user) make the final call.

* Matching game: Daily SMS drop into the group chat of two candidate profiles; group votes and you choose — fun, low-pressure, iterative.

* Backed by cross-platform match search: our system hunts across all Match Group brands to find your best fit (not just Tinder).

* Trust badge: “Profile Created With Friends” signals authenticity, builds confidence for you and others.

**Target Audience:**  
Women who aren’t yet on dating apps — curious, maybe a little hesitant, but ready with some social momentum (friends nudging). This is the social-door into dating, made easy, fun, friendly.

**Success Metrics (Hackathon version):**

* Profile creation rate: % of users completing profile via the group chat flow.

* Match closures: Women getting to the match stage across the portfolio.

* 6-way chat →  at least 6 messages in the conversation flow.

* Daily drop engagement: % of days with votes cast in the group by friends \+ user.

* Virality / share rate: How often users invite friends via invite code or QR.

* User sentiment: Qualitative feedback from the chat flow — “It felt like we were just texting our friends”.

* Badge activation: % of profiles created with friends that display the “vouch” badge.

**Differentiator / Why We’ll Win:**

A multi-brand, social entry point to the Match ecosystem that reduces friction for hesitant users (Abby) and amplifies virality through social play (Jasmine). No other dating experience combines *friend validation, AI personalization,* and *cross-brand intelligence* in a single lightweight flow.

* This is *not* a standalone app; it leverages SMS \+ friends \+ cross-brand search to lower the barrier and raise the fun.

* Unlike traditional solo onboarding, this co-creation model makes the process social, trusted, and less scary.

* Daily match drops \+ group voting \= continuous engagement rather than a one-off profile build.

* Only you control who sees you — you appear to approved folks only — increasing safety and comfort.

* Not just Tinder; full Match Group reach means more opportunity, better fit, stronger narrative (“we search ALL the brands for *you*”).

**Next Steps (Hackathon Roadmap):**

1. Mock SMS chat flow with friends \+ bot persona.

2. Build simple profile-builder engine \+ two-profile daily selection logic \+ voting mechanism.

3. Integrate or simulate cross-brand match API stub (or simulate in prototype).

4. Badge logic & approved-visibility toggle.

5. Prepare pitch deck: run live demo of SMS flow with sample user & friends.

6. Collect initial internal feedback, refine tone, flows, and readiness for potential MVP.
