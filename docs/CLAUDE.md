We are building this application for a hackathon.

Let's use JavaScript + JSdoc for ease of iteration and some validation of types. 

Since we are going to be moving fast, speed of iteration is important, and so therefore, add ways to quickly test things when they go wrong, for example, adding debug logs at key locations so we can see what's going wrong and how.
