Participants: Abby, Lena, Jasmine, mchd

🎬 INTRO / ONBOARDING
Lena: okay but like… are we blocking Jake for real this time
Jasmine: girl, just do it. block him and get back on the dating apps
Abby: ugh idk… feels weird thinking about dating again
Lena: it’s not about Jake. it’s about you feeling good again
Jasmine: speaking of, I found something that might help
*adds mchd to the chat*
Jasmine: it’s called mchd. it helps you get back out there without having to make a whole profile or start swiping
Jasmine: Abby’s back on the market! 
mchd: hey everyone. so I hear we’re helping Abby get back out there? I promise this will be easy. we’ll just chat and figure out what you’re into, then go from there.
Abby: oh, this is actually kinda cool

🌱 PHASE 1: Who’s Abby Looking For?

mchd: first things first. how do you usually label your orientation Abby?
Abby: straight
mchd: got it. now tell me what you’re open to: 
1. Long-term only 💍
2. Long-term, open to short 🌱
3. Short-term, open to long 💃
4. Still figuring it out  🤔 

Abby: 2 feels right. or 4. idk
Jasmine: I would’ve voted 3 but okay
Lena: ignore her. 2 is totally your pace
mchd: “Long-term, open to short” noted! 

mchd: next up, “hear me out” round. pick a celeb crush who might not be everyone’s type, but you totally get it.
Abby: Barry Keoghan  
Lena: wow, okay, that’s a choice  
Jasmine: chaotic little gremlin man, I support it  
mchd: interesting pick. what’s the draw?  
Abby: I don’t know, he’s got this kind of unhinged energy but feels really earnest and endearing underneath  
mchd: love that. so you’re into people who are a little unhinged, but still earnest and endearing — a bit of both  
Abby: yeah, that’s pretty accurate  


mchd: what about your physical type? any preferences?  
Abby: maybe 5'10 or above, but not a dealbreaker  
Abby: actually, just taller than me would be nice  
mchd: fair. how tall are you?  
Abby: 5'6  
mchd: got it. is that a hard dealbreaker or flexible?  
Abby: taller than me at least. that’s my only rule

mchd: perfect lineup: fun, relaxed, confident. nice mix.  
Abby: love it  

Mchd: alright, photos are done. Abby’s friends, send me quick voice notes — what are her green flags?
🎙️ Jasmine:
“Okay, so Abby’s honestly one of the kindest people I know.
 She’ll text you reminders to drink water, and she actually means it.
 She’s a psych major at Indiana University, works part-time at that cozy café with the books in the window.
 Her dog Cleo is basically her best friend, she takes her everywhere.
 She’s not really a big partier, more into slow weekends, wine nights, and long walks.
 Dating Abby would just feel really warm, like you could finally relax around someone.”
🎙️ Lena:
“Abby’s the kind of person who just gets people.
She remembers the smallest things, like what you said in passing two months ago.
If something’s off, she’ll check in without making a big deal about it.
She doesn’t go out much, but she’ll always show up when it matters.
She’s been through a lot, so she takes her time with people, but once she trusts you, she’s all in.
And Cleo’s basically her sidekick, they’re kind of a package deal.”

mchd: okay, those were solid green flags. “loyal, thoughtful, and accidentally the group therapist.” 
mchd: Abby, anything you’d add about yourself? what’s the vibe you’d want someone new to get from you?
Abby: hmm, probably that I’m easy to talk to but kind of shy at first
Abby: but once I’m comfortable I’ll probably overshare
mchd: love that. “quiet at first, but lowkey funny once you get to know me.” I think I’ve got what I need to start pulling your bio now:
📝 option a:
good vibes, good coffee, and an unhealthy attachment to my dog
📝 option b:
psych major with a soft spot for dogs, probably at a café pretending to study
Abby: definitely b
Abby: that one actually sounds like me
mchd: agreed. dropping it into your profile.  ready for your preview link?  
Abby: let’s see it! 
mchd: alright, it’s up. check it out!
