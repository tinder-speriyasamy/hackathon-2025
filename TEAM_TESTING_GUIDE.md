# Team Testing Guide - AI Matchmaker

Hey team! Here's how to test our WhatsApp AI matchmaker app. This should take ~5 minutes.

## What You're Testing
An AI matchmaker that helps you create a dating profile with input from your friends in a WhatsApp group chat.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Add the Bot to WhatsApp
- Open WhatsApp on your phone
- Add this number to your contacts: **+1 (415) 523-8886**
- Or just open WhatsApp and message: **+14155238886**
- Save it as "AI Matchmaker" or whatever you want

### 2. Start a Conversation
**Option A: Test Solo**
- Send any message to the bot (try "Hi" or "Hello")
- The AI will introduce itself and start helping you create a profile

**Option B: Test in a Group (Recommended!)**
- Create a new WhatsApp group
- Add 1-2 other team members to the group
- Add the bot (+14155238886) to the group
- Send a message to start ("Hey AI matchmaker!")
- Now everyone can help create the profile together

### 3. Follow the AI's Lead
The AI will guide you through:
- Collecting basic info (name, gender, interests)
- Uploading a photo (send any image via WhatsApp)
- Creating a dating profile summary
- Reviewing and confirming your profile

**Tips:**
- Answer naturally - the AI understands conversational responses

- The AI will show you a profile card preview before finalizing
